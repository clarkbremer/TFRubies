## Sketchup Extensions for Timber Framers ##

*If you just want to install the extensions, you're in the wrong place.*  Choose `window | extension warehouse` from the Sketchup menu.  Search the warehouse for **Timber Framing Extensions**, and install like any other plugin.  This is just the location to store and share the source code.

---
I'd happily accept help from anyone who wants to contribute some code to this project.  Below is a list of features I'd like to add, but feel free to come up with your own.

## To Do: ##
* Write our own version of "cut face" so we can cut multiple faces.  
	- Need to mark the "cutting face" on joint components,
* Bug: if timber name has illegal characters (like forward slash), save shop drawings fails.  
	- Need to scrub the name first.
* Hide cosmetic pegs before shop drawings and timber lists
* For finding extreme faces for ref faces, break ties with face size (as we already do with direction labels)
* Feature to make ALL shop drawings all at once.
